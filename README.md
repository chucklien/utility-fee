This project is trying to use pwa to create a calculator for the utility fee with other floor mates.


```
    ($2775.6/1135)*855.4+($63.6/2)+($1365+$500)/2
    (-----A-----)*--B--+(--C-/2)+(---D----)/2

    A: current period electricity utility fee/ kWh
    B: this period usage of electirc kWh
    C: public eletricity usage fee
